# TravelingSalesmanProblemWebApp
This is a simple web application, which is created with ASP.NET Core and React.js, that employs a genetic evolutive algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem.

It provides to the user the possibility of uploading a text file, which contains a set of coordinates, along with some parameters that represent the thoroughness of the search for an optimal answer.

This is the first version of the project. For the moment, the application uses some extremely simple designs (as an example example: the way this application keeps track of who is creating a request), but these will be improved in the future.

Some future goals for this application:

* User authentication
* A simpler way for the user to choose how complex the search for an answer should be
* More interesting input data
* The possibility for the user to format the input data as they want to
* A graphical representation of the found answer (for not so large inputs)
